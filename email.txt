Dear CEO, 

This email will cover my basic analysis of national retail sales data for our portfolio company.

Monthly aggregations of gross revenue data across all locations show spikes of approximately $2 billion every third month. The profit margin %'s do not show as obvious of a cycle, however.

To perform a fair comparison of profit margin %'s between owned and rented locations, I imputed "Rental cost" data for owned locations. The values were predicted by a Linear Regression model that took in data for "Gross revenue", "Fixed cost", "Rental cost", and "Number of products". The model was trained on "Rental cost" data from rented locations.

Finally, I attempted to understand the main driver of a high profit margin %, and I found a very strong correlation between the "Number of products" variable and "Profit Margin %". I included cost of living information for each state in this analysis. I suspect a higher variety of items at a store increases chances for upselling, and the additional items stocked at stores with a larger-than-average assortment of items may have higher individual profit margins.

I would like to improve the amount of data our pipelines are allowing us to ingest and analyze for the upcoming year. This may allow me to analyze profit margins at a individual product level.

Please let me know if I can provide any additional details on this analysis. 

Best regards, 

Rachit Pareek
